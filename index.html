        <!-- some text explaining what this website is about and introducing the user to the narrative and experience that is Spock's Super Safe Space Station Spectacular Spaghetti Shop -->
        <p>Welcome to Spock's Super Safe Space Station Spectacular Spaghetti Shop.</p>
        <p>After the end of the 5 year mission and his subsequent departure from the USS Enterprise, Mr. Spock realized that he was destined for something greater than bureaucracy. Space exploration & serving in active duty aboard a starship was always his first & best destiny, but as the Enterprise was undergoing a refit, he was unable to continue space exploration. He decided, then, to pursue his secondary passion: spaghetti.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Mr. Spock had been fascinated by spaghetti for his entire life. Growing up on the planet Vulcan, his mother, a Human, was the only one who had any knowledge of the dish, and she passed down all she knew about it to him. The two would carefully create incredible bowls of spaghetti all the time, much to the confusion of Mr. Spock's father. Though he moved away from Vulcan to pursue a career in Starfleet, he kept the spaghetti recipe carefully preserved in his memory, should he ever need it again.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Without a purpose or any possibilities that interested him, he thought back to his childhood, to the nights spent creating marvellous bowls of spaghetti with his mother. He logically came to the conclusion that as he had nothing else to do, nowhere else to go where his incredible quantity of skills could be properly utilized, he would have to create an opportunity for himself. He wanted to stay in space, but was logically repulsed by the thought of serving on a ship that was not pursuing intellectual growth, so instead he purchased a space station. He additionally purchased a vast quantity of kitchen supplies and ingredients. Using his advanced computer qualifications, he created this wonderful website, and began taking orders. Thus, Spock's Super Safe Space Station Spectacular Spaghetti Shop was created. </p>
